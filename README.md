# AT THE CURRENT TIME IN DEVELOPMENT, THIS README FILE IS *VERY* OUTDATED, I WILL UPDATE IT AS SOON AS 0.3 IS READY TO RELEASE!

I'm currently working with https://github.com/Luisinhi010 to make this thing better

# Current Plans:

* Fix all current issues with Opponent Mode
* Noteskins on Options Menu
* Softcoded Judgements (maybe??)
* Separated Noteskins for each Player **(maybe??)**
* Remove the Additional Hitsounds, making it a Toggle, and *(probably)* softcoding Hitsounds as a whole

* Updating this entire file because it's outdated at the moment lol

this should be enough for any pc to run!

* QUICK NOTE: This does not disable the HUD, or Note Splashes entirely, it's up to you to disable them in the game options!

## Letter Grading System!
